# BlobCats
A rich repositery of BlobCat emojis, derived from Google's blob emojis

Honestly I just made this because even though these emojis were everywhere, they weren't properly licensed or credited to the artist

## Installation

A special thanks goes to [Siara-San](https://www.instagram.com/sairaa.jpg/) for creating some of these

All SVG files were done by me by hand (TwT)
